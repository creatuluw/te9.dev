# The AI development framework for fast-moving teams

**Build production software with AI agents that understand your project.**

te9.dev gives developers what generic AI coding assistants never could: structured workflows with complete traceability. Run development exactly the way you want. Launch documented, tested features in hours, and ship with complete confidence.

---

## Built for developers. Not experimentation.

AI coding assistants are built for quick snippets, code completion, and one-off suggestions. Developers are usually left wrestling with inconsistent code, undocumented features, and workflows that don't scale.

te9.dev is made for people who actually build production software. Day in. Day out.

---

## Finally, development as disciplined as your business.

Define your workflow from scratch. Not just the code, but everything from PRD to deployment, right to the core.

Features, bugfixes, refactors, tests, documentation, commits — whatever your project needs. No extra bloat.

---

## Workflows you'll love to use every day

Clean, structured, and reliable. Processes built to make development teams productive from the start. No guessing required.

### PRD-Driven Development
Every feature starts with documented requirements, acceptance criteria, and success metrics. No scope creep, no vague specs.

### AI Memory System
Your AI remembers your patterns, decisions, and preferences across sessions. It learns from every interaction, getting smarter about your project.

### Zero-Tolerance Testing
100% test pass rate required before any PRD completes. No regressions, no broken builds, no surprises.

### Design-System-Driven UI
Generate accessible, consistent UI components automatically. WCAG AA compliant by default.

## Part of your workflow

te9.dev works with your existing tools and infrastructure. Keep everything working smoothly together.

```bash
skill("prd-interview")   # Gather requirements
skill("prd-execute")     # Implement features
skill("prd-test")        # Verify 100% test pass
skill("prd-track")       # Log progress + commit
```

---

## Own your code. Stay in control.

Your codebase is too critical to hand off to black-box AI platforms. te9.dev gives you a clean, structured foundation you actually control, built on engineering best practices.

**With te9.dev, you don't just code faster.** **You plan faster.** **You ship faster.**

## Quick Start

**Copy these files into your project:**

```bash
# Copy these folders
.opencode/
.zed/
dev/

# Copy these files
AGENTS.md
opencode.json
te9.md
```

**Then start working:**

1. Open OpenCode or Zed with MCP support
2. Ask the AI: "What skills are available?"
3. Start with `skill("prd-interview")` to begin
