## Technical Skills

Tools in `.opencode/tool/`:
- `daisyui.ts` - UI component templates
- `knowledge_graph.ts` - Memory graph export
- `melt.ts` - Code processing

## Memory System

OpenMemory is configured in `opencode.json` and documented in `openmemory.md`.

All spec-related work is automatically stored in OpenMemory for context.
