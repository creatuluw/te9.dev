# Building Developer Workflows

A good developer workflow reduces friction and lets you focus on what matters: shipping quality code. Here's how we approach workflow design.

## Core Principles

1. **Automation over memorization**: If you do it twice, automate it
2. **Consistency over flexibility**: Standard patterns reduce cognitive load
3. **Documentation over assumptions**: Write it down, it didn't happen

## The Daily Flow

### Morning Routine

Start with a clean slate. Pull latest changes, check CI status, review your tasks.

### Deep Work Blocks

Protect focused time. Turn off notifications. Use a timer. Ship something.

### End of Day

Leave a trail. Update tickets. Push your branch. Write tomorrow's first step.

## Tools That Help

- **Git hooks**: Enforce standards before commits
- **CI/CD**: Automate testing and deployment
- **Linters**: Catch issues early
- **Documentation**: Keep knowledge accessible

## Measuring Success

Track metrics that matter:

- Time from idea to production
- Number of failed deployments
- Developer satisfaction scores

The best workflow is one your team actually uses consistently.
